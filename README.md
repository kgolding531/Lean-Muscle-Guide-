So the plan was to create a website to publicly display my workout regime and was inspired by this project on Replit:

## **SMV Calculator**

https://smvcalculator.replit.app/

And yes, I do realize that both are very different from each other, but then that's me for you - always trying to do above and beyond.

And so I have decided to archive this project due to the sheer complexity of it. I hadn't realized that building a website could be so time consuming and difficult. But then this is warranted considering that I still need practice to actually learn how to do this stuff.

I am not sure if I am just giving up, but I think I need to focus my time and skills on other stuff that I need to get done. The main aim was to get practice so that I was able to build the HVNCOG website for my church. 

But in any case, if I or anyone would like to continue this project in the future they can using this information below:
